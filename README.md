# bouncingBallGame

This is a very basic bouncingBallGame.

One of the first project's I have undertaken throughout my first year of University in module "Computer Systems".
The goal of the project was the create a rectangular vertical object at the side of the users screen. Object is controlled by users mouse, if the ball object makes a connect with the rectangular object (paddle) it is reflected.

The wall closest to the paddle, is the "death" wall.... if the ball makes a connection with the wall the game ends and score is reset.
